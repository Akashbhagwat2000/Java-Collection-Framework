# Java-Collection-Framework

The Java Collection Framework is a set of classes and interfaces provided by Java to handle and manipulate groups of objects. It provides a unified architecture for storing, retrieving, and manipulating collections of objects efficiently. The Collection Framework includes various interfaces and classes that serve different purposes. Here's an overview of the main components of the Java Collection Framework:

1. **Interfaces**:
   - `Collection`: The root interface of the collection hierarchy. It defines the basic operations and behaviors common to all collection types.
   - `List`: An ordered collection that allows duplicate elements. Implementations include `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`.
   - `Set`: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements. Implementations include `HashSet` and `TreeSet`.
   - `Queue`: A collection designed for holding elements before processing. Implementations include `LinkedList` and `PriorityQueue`.
   - `Map`: An object that maps keys to values. Implementations include `HashMap` and `TreeMap`.

2. **Classes**:
   - `ArrayList`: A resizable array-based implementation of the `List` interface.
   - `LinkedList`: A doubly-linked list implementation of the `List` and `Queue` interfaces.
   - `HashSet`: A hash table-based implementation of the `Set` interface. Does not guarantee order.
   - `TreeSet`: A tree-based implementation of the `Set` interface. Elements are sorted in a natural order.
   - `HashMap`: A hash table-based implementation of the `Map` interface. Provides key-value pairs.
   - `TreeMap`: A tree-based implementation of the `Map` interface. Keys are sorted in a natural order.

3. **Utility Classes**:
   - `Collections`: Provides various utility methods for working with collections, such as sorting, searching, and synchronization.
   - `Arrays`: Provides utility methods for working with arrays, such as sorting and searching.

The Java Collection Framework provides a wide range of functionality for storing, manipulating, and traversing collections of objects. It offers flexibility and efficiency by providing different implementations for various collection types. By using the appropriate collection classes and interfaces, you can handle data structures efficiently in your Java programs.
